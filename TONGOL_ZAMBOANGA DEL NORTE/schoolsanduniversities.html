  <p><mark>1.Andres Bonifacio College</mark></p> <img src="abc.png" width="300" height="200"> 
   <center><p>Andres Bonifacio College (ABCollege or ABC) is a community college institution in the Philippines. Its campus is located at College Park, Brgy. Miputak, Dipolog. ABCollege offers course programs from kindergarten to postgraduate levels. Alumni and students of the college are referred to as Bonifacians.
       <br>
       Andres Bonifacio College was founded in 1940 as Andres Bonifacio Institute by Amando B. Amatong and Felicidad S. Amatong. The college was named after Andres Bonifacio, a revolutionary leader, to which Amando himself found inspiration being born to poverty in Dalaguete, Cebu. The original location of ABI used to be in what is now Festival Shopping Arcade 1 in Rizal Avenue corner Magsaysay Street, Barangay Central.
<br>
Amando Amatong died on April 21, 1943, leaving his wife Felicidad to operate the institute while taking care of their eight young children. To maintain ABI's operation, Amando's youngest brother Silverio B. Amatong was appointed as the institute's president. From its original campus used since its founding, the college permanently transferred to what it is now known as College Park in Barangay Miputak after a fire razed the institute's buildings and nearby structures to the ground in 1968.
