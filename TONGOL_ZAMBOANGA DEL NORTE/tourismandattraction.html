<center><h3><li><em>Casa Bernedo</em></li></h3></center>
<center><img src="casa.jpg" height="100" width="300"><center></center>
<center><p>Casa Bernedo, also known as the Bernedo Ancestral House, is a two-storey ancestral house in Dipolog, Zamboanga del Norte in the Philippines.
<br>
    The house was the residence of the then-influential Bernedo family of Dipolog. It was built by the turn of the 20th century by a Spaniard named Justo Bernedo and his wife Isabel Macias, a Filipina from Dipolog, where they raised their nine children together. The Bernedo house largely retained its original structure, only undergoing a minor renovation shortly after the end of World War II. Known to be an influential and a religious family in Dipolog's earliest days, the Bernedos hosted numerous dignitaries and VIPs who visited Dipolog in the house, including the town's Catholic church clergy and Philippine President Ramon Magsaysay.
<br>
Following the death of the last of the nine surviving Bernedo-Macias siblings in 2008, the Bernedo house was closed permanently. On July 1, 2012, the Bernedo house, now named Casa Bernedo, was reopened to the public as the Dipolog City Center for the Culture and the Arts in time for the city's centenary to be observed exactly a year later.
<br>
Today, Casa Bernedo serves as a museum and art gallery. The lower floor, which was said to be a small storage house or warehouse (commonly known as a bodega), serves as a venue for visual art and photography exhibits. Another room on the lower floor was used as a local gun store, until that space is currently occupied as the city's tourism office by the City Government of Dipolog.
<br>
The second floor, where the Bernedo-Macias family once lived, serves as a museum preserving the family house's interior and arrangements. The floors and their home appliances were all made out of Philippine hardwood, and their kitchen appliances were all imported from the United States. It was said that the kitchen, also on the upper floor, had a story on Dipolog becoming the Spanish sardine capital today when Isabel Macias Bernedo would make Spanish-styled sardines which she learned from her sister Concepcion Macias Monta√±o every summer. Casa Bernedo is open to the public free of charge.

<center><h3><li><em>Jos√© Rizal's farm</em></li></h3></center>
<center><img src="farm.jpg" height="100" width="300"><center></center>
<center><p>
    The farm of Jos√© Rizal (Filipino: Sakahan ni Jose Rizal) is a designated historic site in Katipunan, Zamboanga del Norte, Philippines.
<br>
    When Dr. Jose Rizal reported to Dapitan in Mindanao from 1892 to 1896 by the Spanish government, aside from spending some time in teaching the town folks, he also engaged in medical practice through which he was able to cure the eye ailment of Calixto Carreon. The story said that Calixto offered Dr. Rizal the 40-hectare land as a way to repay him. Dr. Rizal accepted Calixto's offer, but insisted on a payment of ‚Ç±200, which he had won in a lottery organized by the Spanish. Rizal planted coconuts, hemp, sugar cane, and fruit trees on his farm.
<br>
In order to keep the farm under proper management, Dr. Rizal designated one of his sisters, Trinidad, to look after the farm. After several years, Trinidad passed the farm's management to Fernando Egu√≠a, one of Dr. Rizal's students. A marker was installed in the area by the National Historical Institute (NHI) which states that Trinidad sold the land to Crisostomo Egu√≠a Sr., son of Fernando. It was agreed right there and then after the sale that the land would still be registered under the name of Dr. Rizal. Other siblings of Dr. Rizal also witnessed such agreement.
<br>
At present days, the farm is under the care of the children of Crisostomo Eguia Sr. On a positive note, Director Mary June Bugante of the Department of Tourism Region 9 said her office is constantly in touch with Eguia Family to encourage them to transform the farm into a duly recognized tourist destination.

<center><h3><li><em>Jos√© Rizal Memorial Protected Landscape</em></li></h3></center>
<center>The Jos√© Rizal Memorial Protected Landscape, also known as the Rizal Park and Shrine, is a protected landscape and memorial to the Philippines' national hero located in the city of Dapitan on the island of Mindanao. It preserves the farm site in barrio Talisay where Jos√© Rizal was exiled for four years from 1892-1896 after being accused of sedition and plotting the Philippine revolution in Manila by the Spanish colonial authorities.[1] The protected area was established in 1940 as the Rizal National Park covering an initial area of 10 hectares (25 acres) through Proclamation No. 616 signed by President Manuel Luis Quezon. In 2000, it was enlarged to its present size of 439 hectares (1,080 acres) with a buffer zone of 15 hectares (37 acres) and was declared a protected landscape under the National Integrated Protected Areas System through Proclamation No. 279.
<br> 
<br>
    The Jos√© Rizal Memorial Protected Landscape occupies a hilly peninsula facing the Dapitan Bay in Zamboanga del Norte. It is located in the seaside barangay of Talisay, about a kilometer northwest from the Dapitan city proper.
<br>
<br>
The 16-hectare (40-acre) estate in Talisay was purchased by Rizal for P4,000 after winning the Reales Loter√≠as Espa√±olas de Filipinas (English: Royal Spanish Lottery of the Philippines) two months after arriving in Dapitan.[1][4] Rizal built houses in the site, started a farm, put up a school for boys, and built a hospital where he could practice medicine and treat the poor for free. For four years, he worked as a rural physician, farmer, merchant, inventor, painter, sculptor, archaeologist, linguist, teacher, architect, poet, biologist and environmentalist. His mother, Teodora Alonso, sisters and other relatives would later on come to live with him in the farm. In 1897, after Rizal was executed, these properties were confiscated by the Spanish colonial government as indemnity to the state and transferred to the custody of Don Cosme Borromeo. The site was then converted into a public park in 1913 with the structures built by Rizal reconstructed on their original sites.

    Other structures found in the park include a dam constructed by Rizal, an aqueduct, a water reservoir, an amphitheater and a museum. The Rizaliana Museum built in 1971 contains the hero's memorabilia including the blackboard and table he used for teaching. It is located near the park's entrance which also houses the office of the shrine curator. A large rock in the middle of the park known as Mi Retiro Rock marks the spot where Rizal wrote his poems Mi Retiro (My Retreat) and Himno a Talisay (Hymn to Talisay) about his life in exile in Dapitan.
